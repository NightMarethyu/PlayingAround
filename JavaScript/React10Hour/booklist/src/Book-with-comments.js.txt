// Quick notes on default exports:

// There can only be one default export in a file. This makes logical sense so you don't have conflicts
// A benefit of using default exports is we can rename them in our linked files, so I can
// Book here and in the file that references this I can call it BookCard or if that makes more sense for that file
// If its not the default export than renaming it is not allowed.

export default Book
