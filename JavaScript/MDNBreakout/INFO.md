This folder contains the results of following the code from the Mozilla Developers Network on making a simple Breakout style game. I started by making it in pure JavaScript, then I took the code provided and began making it more Object Oriented to try to make levels and such, turn it into a proper game. I'm currently in the process of refactoring the code to do the OO thing now. I have plans to continue that until I get to a decent point. After that we will see where I go. MDN also has a similar tutorial for building with the Phaser JS game engine so maybe I'll try that.
