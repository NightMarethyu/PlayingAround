This is my notes following along with the Odin Project. I wanted to look into Ruby and I knew that the Odin Project is resource for learning Ruby.

I only decided to start adding to a GitHub repo when I was on the lesson on Loops. I've got some experience with Python so my notes aren't going to be too extensive.
