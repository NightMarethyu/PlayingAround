# Problem solving is probably the most important skill that a software developer
# can learn. Because creating software is problem solving. You solve problems
# by writing code, those problems may be mathematics, measuring the acidity
# of soil, or how to watch more videos online.

# The best way to become a better problem solver is to write a lot of code.
# Write lots of different programs and solve lots of problems. This may sound
# cliche, but practice makes perfect.

# The first thing you must do to solve problems is to understand the problem
# if you don't understand it and can't explain it in plain English, then you
# will never be able to know if you solved the problem because you didn't know
# what you were solving in the first place

# Step two is to plan. If you know what the problem is then you need to plan
# how you will go about trying to solve the problem. Ask yourself some questions
# Will there be a UI (user interface)? What will it look like? What will be the
# inputs to your program? What do you want your program to output?

# Once you have a plan, write out some pseudo code. Don't jump right into writing
# the actual code, write a plain-text explaination as to how you will get certain
# outputs based on your inputs.

# Now that you have a plan and a simple write-up as to how to get the outputs you
# want from your program, you should have an idea of sub-problems. Make a list of
# these sub-problems. This should give you a basic outline for your code and make
# it a less daunting task to know where to begin. Even if you don't know all the
# steps that your software will need to perform to be successful, you will know
# where to start.

# A rookie mistake is to try to tackle the whole problem at once. THIS IS BAD PRACTICE
# How do you eat an elephant? One bite at a time. Break the problem down into managable
# parts and you won't tie yourself in knots.
